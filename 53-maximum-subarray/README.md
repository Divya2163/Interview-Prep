#Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.
<hr>
<p>Difficulty : Medium</p>
 

Example 1:
<br>
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]<br>
Output: 6<br>
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.<br><br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]<br>
Output: 23<br>
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.<br><br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104<br>
 <br><br>

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
